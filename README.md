# Project3 Pizza

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is a fully funcional food ordering system made in django.
Beside python I did use bootstrap 4 for better control of all DOMs elements.
No javascript has been used.

<ul>
<li>index.html, login.html, signin.html, menu.html extends layout.html file 
<li>my_orders.html and orders_manager shows list of all orders
<li>models.py contain all data structures
<li>urls.py contain routes to functions
<li>views.py cotain main program and fuctions which renders html files
</ul>

Also in static folder there are pictures and styles.css file which contain additional styling for html 

Program automatically create superuser account at first start so <i><b>make sure to change those parameters as per your wish before running</b></i>.

My personal touch allowing site administrator to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders

<h3> To see it working u can clone or download and run on your pc.</h3>
